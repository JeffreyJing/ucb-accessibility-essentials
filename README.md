# ucb-accessibility-essentials
Repository for the first assignment on HTML, CSS, and UI accessibility essentials.
Over the course of the last few lectures, our course material emphasized the need
for accessibility in everything that we create, as it is quickly becoming an industry standard
for everything to be reachable and accessible to everyone. Using HTML and CSS, 
this assignment teaches us how to utilize web design tools to ensure accessibility while
maintaining a high quality codebase that promotes long term sustainability 
(ie. when the original programmer is long gone, the code should still be not only usable
but easily understandable to all who contribute to it in the future). The webpage I've designed
in style.css and index.html highlights and promotes all of the aforementioned qualities.
